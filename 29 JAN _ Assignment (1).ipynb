    "\"\"\"1.Who developed python programming language ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Guido van Rossum developed python programming language.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Which type of programming does python support ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is an interpreted programming language, supporting object-oriented, structured, and functional programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Is python case sensitive when dealing with identifiers?\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, Python is a case-sensitive language, i.e., it treats uppercase and lowercase characters differently. This applies to identifiers too. You must avoid using the same name with different cases while naming identifiers. It is always good to use names that are more easily understood. If you want to store counts of 2 values, you would rather name your variables count1 and count2 instead of naming them C and c. Although the latter would give you separate variables, it can cause a lack of understanding in the longer run.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. What is the correct extension of Python file?\n",
    "\n",
    "correct extension for Python files is .py\n",
    "\n",
    "5.Is python code compiled or interpeted?\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is an interpreted language, which means the source code of a Python program is converted into bytecode that is then executed by the Python virtual machine. Python is different from major compiled languages, such as C and C + +, as Python code is not required to be built and linked like code for these languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "6.Name a few block of code used to define in python language?\n",
    "\n",
    "Indentation is used to define a block of code in python. Braces {} are used to define a block of code in most programming languages, like C, C++, and Java. But this indentation makes python unique among all programming languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "This indentation highlights the block of code. In Python, indentation is done with whitespace. All statements with the same right-hand distance belong to the same code block. If a block needs to be more nested, it is indented to the right.\n",
    "\n",
    "Indentation is only used in most other programming languages to help make the code look nice. However, it is required in Python to indicate which block of code a statement belongs to.\n",
    "\n",
    "###example :  Program for Checking names using Python\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "name = 'Alex'\n",
    "    \n",
    "if name == 'Alex':\n",
    "    print('Correct Name!!')\n",
    "else:\n",
    "\tprint('InCorrect Name:(')\n",
    "print('HI')\n",
    "  \n",
    "  output:\n",
    "  \n",
    "  Correct Name!!\n",
    "HI\n",
    "\n",
    "7.State a character used to give single line commments in python?\n",
    "\n",
    "We can write a single-line comment by adding a single # character before any statement or line of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example :\n",
    "\n",
    "# This is a Comment\n",
    "print(\"Hello world\")\n",
    "\n",
    "output:\n",
    "\n",
    "Hello World\n",
    "\n",
    "8.Mention functions which can help us to find the version of python that we are currently working on.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get the Version of the python Interpreter, they are listed as follows:\n",
    "Using sys. version method.\n",
    "Using python_version() function.\n",
    "Using Python -V command.\n",
    "\n",
    "9.Python supports to make anonymous functions which are not bound to a name(@ runtime). It uses a construct called \"lambda\" .\n",
    "\n",
    "10. pip stands for \"preferred installer program\".\n",
    "\n",
    "11. Mention a few builts in function in python?\n",
    "\n",
    "print( ) function\n",
    "type( ) function\n",
    "input( ) function\n",
    "abs( ) function\n",
    "pow( ) function\n",
    "dir( ) function\n",
    "sorted( ) function\n",
    "max( ) function\n",
    "round( ) function\n",
    "divmod( ) function\n",
    "id( ) function\n",
    "ord( ) function\n",
    "len( ) function\n",
    "sum( ) function\n",
    "help( ) function\n",
    "\n",
    "12.What is the maximum possible length of an identifier in python?\n",
    "\n",
    "An identifier can have a maximum length of 79 characters in Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "13. What are the benefits of using python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages of Python: simple, clean, and fast to write\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to easy syntax, it gained popularity not only among software engineers but also with data scientists and academic researchers. Its simplicity is best for overcoming complex problems and make it the most popular choice for machine learning and data processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "14.How is memory managed in python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Python uses a portion of the memory for internal use and non-object memory. Another part of the memory is used for Python object such as int, dict, list, etc. CPython contains the object allocator that allocates memory within the object area. The object allocator gets a call every time the new object needs space.\n",
    "\n",
    "15.How to install python on Windows and set path variables?\n",
    "\n",
    "Install python from this link https://www.python.org/downloads/ .\n",
    "\n",
    "During installation time , In the section entitled User Variables, double-click on the entry that says Path. Another window will pop up showing a list of paths. Click the New button and paste the path to your Python executable there. Once that’s inserted, select your newly added path and click the Move Up button until it’s at the top.\n",
    "\n",
    "16. Is indentation required on python ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line. Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, the indentation in Python is very important. Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.\"\"\""
